When someone has chest pain, dizziness, or trouble breathing â€“ every second counts. In a cardiac emergency, the ER team first checks vitals, ECG, and gives oxygen or pain relief.

If itâ€™s a heart attack, they may shift to ICU or cath lab and start treatment fast â€” with angiography, blood thinners or stents.

At Care and Cure Hospital, the emergency and cardiology team work together for quick diagnosis and treatment â€” even in the middle of the night.

Always call ahead or use their ambulance service for faster care.
